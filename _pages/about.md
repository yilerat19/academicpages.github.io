About me
======

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Heliophysics Research and Applications (HeRA) group](https://www.ilie.ece.illinois.edu/) within [the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Raluca Ilie](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/rilie). My primary research focus is understanding the acceleration mechanisms responsible for ionospheric outflow, and its impacts on the magnetospheric dynamics.

I joined the group with an Electrical Engineering background and almost zero knowledge about the Space Science. However, through the rigorous training at UIUC I quickly developed the skills to become an expert in modeling the ionospheric outflow. My work has been recognized by the American Geophysical Union, where I was awarded [the Outstanding Student Presentation Award both in 2019 and 2020](https://ece.illinois.edu/newsroom/news/7615). In 2020, I was elected as [the Student Representative of the NSF Geospace Environment Modeling Program](https://ece.illinois.edu/newsroom/news/17359), where I will serve for the next two years (2020 - 2022).

Outside the scholarly activities, I enjoy watching movies and sports games, baking, hiking, planting and doing yoga.
